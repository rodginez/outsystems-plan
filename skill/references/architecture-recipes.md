  Architecture-level design principles for OutSystems ODC builds — not
  Mentor-prompt fixes for a specific widget/bug, but structural decisions
  that shape how a wave is scoped and how assets relate to each other.
  Read this BEFORE scoping any wave that introduces a new kind of asset
  (an AI Agent, an external integration, a shared Library) or that could
  tempt bundling a new capability directly into an existing app's own
  server actions. Companion to `recipes.md` (UI/Mentor-prompt patterns)
  and `backend-and-data-gotchas.md` (Server Action/entity/aggregate
  gotchas) — this file is one level up: decisions about asset boundaries,
  not about what happens inside one action.

# Architecture recipes

Each entry here is a structural principle, not a copy-paste prompt block
— apply it when *scoping* a wave (deciding what asset does what), before
writing any spec or firing Mentor.

## Recipe: an agent must not be coupled to the project that calls it

**When to use:** any wave that introduces an AI/LLM-backed capability —
suggestion generation, summarization, classification, extraction,
orchestration — not just one specific project. This applies the moment a
wave's spec says something like "the app calls an AI model to produce
X," regardless of how small that first version looks.

**The principle:** Build the agent as its own independent asset — in
this tenant, OutSystems' native `AIAgent` asset type (confirmed to exist
as a first-class, independently-published asset kind alongside
`WebApplication`/`Library`/`Workflow` — `context_agents` lists 21 of them
in this tenant already, none of them owned by or embedded inside a
calling app) — with its own interface, versioning, and test surface.
Never implement the agent's actual logic (prompt construction, model
call, response parsing) as server actions living inside the calling
WebApplication's own OML. The calling app treats the agent the same way
it would treat any third-party API: through a thin, explicit integration
boundary, never by having the agent's reasoning embedded in the app's
own action flow.

**Why this matters:**
1. **Independent iteration.** A prompt tweak or model swap on the agent
   should never force a republish of the calling app, and should never
   re-run that app's unrelated E2E suite. If the agent's logic lives
   inside the app's own server actions, every agent change is
   indistinguishable from an app change.
2. **No data-model leakage into the agent.** If the agent's own
   interface is shaped around the calling app's specific entities (e.g.
   an `AnalisarItemComIA` action that takes an `ItemFicha` record
   directly instead of generic text), the agent becomes unreusable for
   a second ficha type, a second app, or a second tenant. The agent's
   input/output contract should be generic (text in → structured text
   out), not app-entity-shaped.
3. **Failure isolation.** An agent timeout, rate limit, or bad response
   needs to be distinguishable from an app bug at a glance — a stack
   trace inside the calling app's own action means "the app broke";
   isolating the agent as its own asset means an agent failure surfaces
   as an integration/dependency failure instead, which is the correct
   framing and the correct place to retry/fallback logic.
4. **Independent rollback.** A regressive prompt change must be
   revertable by rolling back the agent's own revision, without
   touching (or needing to understand) the calling app's deploy state at
   all — this is the same reasoning behind "revert to last known good"
   in `backend-and-data-gotchas.md` #6, applied one layer up: the
   smaller and more independent the reverted unit, the safer the revert.

**How to apply:**
- The agent's actual reasoning (prompt, model call, response parsing)
  lives in its own `AIAgent` asset, built and published independently.
  Its inputs/outputs are generic (raw text, structured text) — nothing
  named after the calling app's entities.
- The calling app gets exactly one thin integration action per
  capability (e.g. `SolicitarSugestaoIA`) that: reads the app-specific
  data it needs, converts it into the agent's generic input shape, calls
  the agent, and maps the generic output back onto the app's own fields.
  This action — and only this action — is allowed to know about both
  the agent's interface and the app's data model.
- Verify the boundary actually holds: publish a change to the agent
  alone and confirm the calling app's own revision/modelDigest (via
  `app_revisions`) does not change. If it does, something leaked across
  the boundary.

**Red flag this recipe exists to catch:** a wave spec that lists the
AI/LLM call as one more server action alongside the app's other server
actions, with no separate asset mentioned at all — that is the coupling
this recipe prevents. Split it out before scoping the wave further, not
after building it.

## When this file isn't enough

This file holds structural/asset-boundary principles, not UI fixes or
Server Action gotchas — see `recipes.md` and `backend-and-data-gotchas.md`
for those, and `outsystems-app-architecture`/`outsystems-tenant-architecture`
skills for tenant-wide surveys rather than build-time decisions. Add a
new entry here when a wave-scoping decision (not a bug, not a widget
fix) turns out to matter enough that a future wave should make the same
call automatically instead of re-deriving it.
